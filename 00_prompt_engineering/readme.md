## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting instructions that guide AI language models to produce desired outputs. Think of it as learning to communicate effectively with AI systems to achieve specific goals.

**Why is it important?**
- You don't need to be a programmer to use AI effectively
- Good prompts can dramatically improve AI performance
- It's an iterative skill that improves with practice
- It's becoming essential for productivity in many fields

## Prompt engineering vs. context engineering

**Prompt engineering** = crafting the *instruction* you give the model.
**Context engineering** = curating the *information* the model can see when following that instruction.

### Quick contrast

| Aspect          | Prompt engineering                                                       | Context engineering                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal            | Tell the model *how* to behave and *what* to produce                     | Give the model the *facts/examples* it should rely on                                    |
| Levers          | Wording, structure, roles, constraints, output schema, few-shot examples | Retrieval (RAG), documents, knowledge bases, tools/APIs, memory, state across turns      |
| Typical changes | “Be concise. Return valid JSON with fields X/Y/Z.”                       | “Attach the company glossary, latest policy PDF, and retrieved passages for this query.” |
| Failure mode    | Vague instructions → messy/incorrect format                              | Missing/irrelevant info → hallucinations/outdated answers                                |
| Ownership       | UX/prompt designers, app devs                                            | Data/ML/platform teams (pipelines, indexing, chunking, evals)                            |

### How they work together

* Start with a **good prompt**: clear task, constraints, and an **output contract** (e.g., JSON schema).
* Then **ground it with context**: supply only the *most relevant* passages, tables, and tool results.
* The prompt guides *behavior*; the context supplies *knowledge*. You usually need both.

### Concrete examples

1. **Invoice → JSON extractor**

* *Prompt engineering*: “Extract fields {vendor, date, total}. Return JSON only. If a field is missing, use null.”
* *Context engineering*: Provide a few labeled examples and attach the vendor’s invoice spec retrieved via embeddings.

2. **Policy Q\&A bot**

* *Prompt engineering*: “Answer using the attached passages; if unsure, say ‘Not in policy.’ Cite section IDs.”
* *Context engineering*: RAG over your policy repo (chunking, metadata filters like `department=HR`, freshness boosts), plus a recency cache for updates.

3. **Agentic workflow**

* *Prompt engineering*: Tool-use instructions and function signatures.
* *Context engineering*: Feed tool responses (DB rows, API payloads) back into the context window each step; maintain short-term memory/state.

### Practical tips

* Keep prompts **short, specific, and testable**; define output schemas.
* Prefer **few-shot** examples only when they generalize; otherwise move them into **retrieval**.
* For context: optimize **chunking**, **ranking**, **deduping**, and **token budgets**; log what was retrieved for each answer.
* Add **citations** and “answer only from context” instructions when correctness matters.
* Evaluate both layers separately: prompt A/B tests and retrieval quality (precision/recall, groundedness).

**One-liner:** Prompt engineering is *how you ask*; context engineering is *what you show*. Combine them for reliable, scalable LLM apps.


## Understanding Large Language Models

### How LLMs Work (The Basics)

Large Language Models are prediction engines that:
- Take text input (your prompt)
- Predict the next most likely word/token
- Continue this process to generate complete responses
- Base predictions on patterns learned from training data

### Key Concept: Autocompletion
LLMs don't "understand" in the human sense—they're sophisticated autocomplete systems. Your prompt sets up the context for what should come next.

## Essential Configuration Settings

Before diving into prompt techniques, understand these key parameters that control AI behavior:

### Temperature (0-1)
- **Low (0-0.3)**: Focused, consistent, deterministic responses
- **Medium (0.4-0.7)**: Balanced creativity and consistency
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Creative, diverse, but potentially unpredictable

**When to use:**
- Temperature 0: Math problems, factual questions
- Temperature 0.7: Creative writing, brainstorming
- Temperature 0.9: Poetry, experimental content

### Output Length/Token Limits
- Controls maximum response length
- Higher limits = more computational cost
- Set appropriately for your task needs

### Top-K and Top-P (Nucleus Sampling)
- **Top-K**: Limits choices to top K most likely tokens
- **Top-P**: Limits choices based on cumulative probability
- Work together with temperature to control randomness

**Recommended starting points:**
- Conservative: Temperature 0.1, Top-P 0.9, Top-K 20
- Balanced: Temperature 0.2, Top-P 0.95, Top-K 30
- Creative: Temperature 0.9, Top-P 0.99, Top-K 40

## Fundamental Prompting Techniques

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

The simplest approach—just ask directly without examples.

**Example:**
```
Classify this movie review as positive, negative, or neutral:
"The film was visually stunning but the plot felt rushed."
```

**When to use:**
- Simple, well-defined tasks
- When the model has clear knowledge of the domain
- Quick one-off requests

### 2. One-Shot Prompting

Provide a single example to guide the response format.

**Example:**
```
Translate English to French:

English: "Hello, how are you?"
French: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"

English: "Where is the library?"
French:
```

### 3. Few-Shot Prompting

Provide multiple examples to establish a clear pattern.

**Example:**
```
Convert customer feedback to structured data:

Feedback: "Great service, but food was cold"
JSON: {"service": "positive", "food": "negative", "overall": "mixed"}

Feedback: "Amazing experience, will definitely return"
JSON: {"service": "positive", "food": "positive", "overall": "positive"}

Feedback: "Terrible food and rude staff"
JSON:
```

**Best practices:**
- Use 3-5 examples for most tasks
- Include diverse examples
- Mix up the classes in classification tasks
- Ensure examples are high-quality and consistent

### 4. System Prompting

Set overall context and behavior guidelines.

**Example:**
```
You are a helpful travel guide. Provide practical, accurate information about destinations. Always include:
- Key attractions
- Local customs to be aware of
- Budget considerations
- Best time to visit

User: Tell me about visiting Tokyo.
```

### 5. Role Prompting

Assign a specific character or expertise to the AI.

**Example:**
```
Act as an experienced software architect. I need help designing a scalable web application for 1 million users. What architecture patterns should I consider?
```

**Effective roles:**
- Subject matter expert (doctor, lawyer, teacher)
- Creative roles (writer, designer, poet)
- Analytical roles (data analyst, consultant)
- Communication styles (friendly tutor, formal advisor)

### 6. Contextual Prompting

Provide specific background information relevant to the task.

**Example:**
```
Context: You're writing for a tech blog aimed at beginners who have never coded before.

Write a 200-word explanation of what an API is, using simple language and practical examples.
```

## Advanced Prompting Strategies

### Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting

Encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex problems.

**Example:**
```
Solve this step by step:
If I was 6 when my sister was half my age, how old is my sister when I'm 40?

Let me think through this step by step:
```

**When to use:**
- Math problems
- Logical reasoning
- Complex analysis
- Multi-step processes

**Best practices:**
- Use "Let's think step by step" or similar phrases
- Set temperature to 0 for consistent reasoning
- Extract final answers separately from reasoning

### Self-Consistency

Generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer.

**Process:**
1. Ask the same question multiple times with different phrasings
2. Compare the answers
3. Choose the most frequently occurring result

### Step-Back Prompting

Ask a more general question first, then use that context for the specific question.

**Example:**
```
First, what are the key principles of good user interface design?

[Get response]

Now, using those principles, redesign this mobile app's login screen: [description]
```

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

Combine reasoning with tool use or actions.

**Example:**
```
I need to find out how many children the members of Metallica have in total.

Thought: I need to find information about each band member and their children.
Action: Search for "Metallica band members"
Observation: [results]
Thought: Now I need to search for each member individually...
```

### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

Explore multiple reasoning branches simultaneously for complex problems.

**When to use:**
- Creative problem solving
- Strategic planning
- Complex decision-making
- Tasks requiring exploration of alternatives

## Best Practices for Effective Prompts

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

**Bad:**
```
Write about dogs.
```

**Good:**
```
Write a 300-word informative article about the health benefits of owning a dog, focusing on mental health, physical activity, and social connections. Use a friendly, accessible tone for general readers.
```

### 2. Use Action Verbs

Be explicit about what you want the AI to do:
- Analyze, Compare, Create, Describe, Evaluate
- Extract, Generate, List, Rank, Summarize
- Translate, Write, Explain, Classify

### 3. Provide Examples When Possible

Examples are the most powerful way to communicate your expectations.

### 4. Structure Your Prompts

Use clear formatting:
```
Task: [What you want done]
Context: [Background information]
Format: [How you want the output structured]
Example: [Sample of desired output]
```

### 5. Use Instructions Over Constraints

**Better:**
```
Write a professional email summarizing the key points from our meeting.
```

**Avoid:**
```
Write an email but don't make it too long or too informal or too detailed.
```

### 6. Control Output Format

Specify exactly how you want the response structured:
```
Return your answer as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "main_idea": "string",
  "supporting_points": ["string", "string"],
  "confidence_level": "high/medium/low"
}
```

### 7. Use Variables for Reusability

```
Role: You are a {expertise} expert
Task: Analyze the {document_type} and provide recommendations for {target_audience}
Context: This is for a {industry} company with {company_size} employees
```

### 8. Iterate and Document

- Keep track of what works and what doesn't
- Document your successful prompts
- Test variations to improve performance

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Ambiguous Instructions

**Problem:** Vague requests lead to unpredictable outputs
**Solution:** Be specific about what you want

### 2. Contradictory Instructions

**Problem:** Conflicting requirements confuse the model
**Solution:** Review prompts for internal consistency

### 3. Too Many Constraints

**Problem:** Over-constraining limits model creativity
**Solution:** Focus on positive instructions rather than long lists of don'ts

### 4. Ignoring Token Limits

**Problem:** Responses get cut off mid-sentence
**Solution:** Set appropriate limits and structure accordingly

### 5. Not Testing Variations

**Problem:** Assuming first attempt is optimal
**Solution:** Test different phrasings, examples, and approaches

## Hands-On Examples

### Example 1: Content Creation

**Task:** Create a social media post

**Basic prompt:**
```
Write a social media post about coffee.
```

**Improved prompt:**
```
Write an engaging Instagram post for a local coffee shop's new seasonal drink. 

Context: Fall season launch of Pumpkin Spice Maple Latte
Audience: Coffee enthusiasts aged 25-40
Tone: Warm, inviting, not overly promotional
Format: 
- Main text (150 characters max)
- 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Call to action

Include sensory details about taste and aroma.
```

### Example 2: Data Analysis

**Task:** Analyze customer feedback

**Basic prompt:**
```
What do customers think about our product?
```

**Improved prompt:**
```
Analyze the following customer reviews and provide insights:

Reviews: [paste reviews here]

Please provide:
1. Overall sentiment breakdown (positive/negative/neutral percentages)
2. Top 3 most mentioned positive aspects
3. Top 3 most mentioned concerns or issues
4. Specific recommendations for improvement
5. Confidence level in your analysis

Format as a structured report with clear headings.
```

### Example 3: Code Generation

**Task:** Create a function

**Basic prompt:**
```
Write a function to sort a list.
```

**Improved prompt:**
```
Write a Python function that:

Requirements:
- Sorts a list of dictionaries by a specified key
- Handles missing keys gracefully (items without key go to end)
- Supports both ascending and descending order
- Includes proper error handling
- Has clear documentation

Example usage:
data = [{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]
result = sort_by_key(data, "age", descending=False)

Please include:
- Function definition with type hints
- Docstring with parameters and return value
- Example usage
- Brief explanation of the approach
```

## Testing and Iteration

### 1. Create a Testing Framework

Document your prompts systematically:

| Prompt Version | Goal | Model | Temperature | Output Quality | Notes |
|----------------|------|-------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| v1.0 | Generate blog post | GPT-4 | 0.7 | Good | Too formal |
| v1.1 | Generate blog post | GPT-4 | 0.7 | Better | Added tone guidance |

### 2. A/B Test Different Approaches

Try variations:
- Different example sets
- Various instruction phrasings
- Different temperature settings
- Alternative output formats

### 3. Evaluate Results

Consider:
- **Accuracy**: Does it answer correctly?
- **Relevance**: Is it on-topic?
- **Completeness**: Does it cover everything needed?
- **Style**: Does it match the desired tone?
- **Format**: Is it structured as requested?

### 4. Common Evaluation Metrics

- **Consistency**: Same prompt, similar outputs
- **Following instructions**: Adherence to specific requirements
- **Creativity** (when desired): Novel and interesting responses
- **Factual accuracy**: Correctness of information

## Advanced Tips for 2025

### 1. Leverage Structured Outputs

```
Return analysis as JSON:
{
  "summary": "brief overview",
  "key_insights": ["insight1", "insight2"],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "action": "specific action",
      "priority": "high/medium/low",
      "timeline": "timeframe"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Context Management

For long conversations:

### What is Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)?

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a machine learning architecture designed to improve the efficiency and scalability of large models, particularly in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). It draws from the concept of dividing complex tasks among specialized "experts" in a system, allowing the model to activate only a subset of its parameters for a given input rather than using the entire model every time. This sparse activation leads to computational savings while maintaining or even enhancing performance.

#### Key Components of MoE:
1. **Experts**: These are specialized sub-networks (often feed-forward neural networks) within the model, each trained to handle specific types of data or tasks. For example, one expert might specialize in mathematical reasoning, another in creative writing, and so on. In advanced LLMs, there can be dozens or hundreds of experts (e.g., Mixtral 8x7B has 8 experts per layer).

2. **Gating Network (or Router)**: This is a lightweight mechanism (typically a simple neural network) that evaluates the input and decides which experts to route the data to. It assigns weights or probabilities to experts, selecting the top-k (e.g., top 2 out of 8) most relevant ones. The output is a weighted combination of the selected experts' responses. The gating is learned during training and can be dynamic, adapting to the input.

3. **Sparse Activation**: Unlike dense models (e.g., GPT-3 or Llama) where all parameters are activated for every token, MoE activates only a fraction (e.g., 10-20%) of the parameters per input. This makes MoE models "conditionally compute" – they scale to trillions of parameters but run as efficiently as smaller dense models during inference.

#### How MoE Works in LLMs:
- **Training**: During pre-training, the model learns to route inputs to appropriate experts via auxiliary losses (e.g., load balancing to prevent any single expert from being overused). This is often done on massive datasets to ensure experts specialize without overlapping too much.
- **Inference**: For a prompt, the gating network processes the input tokens layer by layer, routing them to experts. This parallelism allows for faster training and inference on hardware like GPUs/TPUs, as unused experts can be skipped.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Efficiency**: Models like Grok-1 (314B parameters but activates ~25% per token) or Mixtral achieve high performance with lower compute costs compared to dense models of similar effective size.
  - **Scalability**: Enables "expert scaling" where adding more experts increases capacity without proportional compute growth.
  - **Specialization**: Experts can capture diverse knowledge, potentially leading to better handling of niche tasks.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - **Routing Instability**: The gating can sometimes fail to balance load, leading to inefficiencies or biases.
  - **Memory Overhead**: Storing many experts requires more memory, though sparsity mitigates runtime costs.
  - **Interpretability Challenges**: It's harder to understand why a specific expert was chosen.

MoE has become prevalent in advanced LLMs since around 2023, with models like Mistral's Mixtral, Google's Switch Transformers, and xAI's Grok-1 adopting it. By 2025, most frontier models (e.g., those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta) incorporate MoE variants for better parameter efficiency in the race toward AGI-scale systems.

### How Does MoE Change Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering – the art of crafting inputs to elicit optimal responses from LLMs – traditionally focuses on clarity, structure, role-playing, chain-of-thought (CoT), and few-shot examples to guide dense models. MoE introduces nuances because of its modular, expert-based design, shifting the focus toward "expert elicitation" and robustness to routing dynamics. While core principles remain, MoE can make prompts more effective (or unpredictable) depending on how they activate the underlying experts. Here's how it impacts the practice:

#### 1. **Need for Expert-Aware Prompting**:
   - In MoE models, the gating mechanism interprets the input to select experts. Vague or overly broad prompts might route to generic experts, leading to mediocre outputs, while targeted prompts can "awaken" specialized ones.
   - **Change**: Engineers must design prompts to signal specific domains. For instance, starting with "As a math expert..." might route to numerical specialists, improving accuracy on equations. This is akin to "role-playing" but more potent due to built-in specialization.
   - **Example**: In a dense model, a simple "Solve 2x + 3 = 7" works fine. In MoE, prefixing with "Using algebraic expertise:" could ensure routing to a math-focused expert, reducing errors from misrouting.

#### 2. **Enhanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Multi-Step Reasoning**:
   - MoE's experts can handle sub-tasks modularly, so prompts that break down problems (e.g., "Step 1: Analyze facts with historical expert. Step 2: Predict with forecasting expert.") leverage routing for better decomposition.
   - **Change**: Prompts become more "orchestrated," explicitly invoking expert-like steps. This can amplify CoT effectiveness, as different experts process intermediate steps. Studies show MoE models excel in long-context reasoning when prompts guide routing progressively.
   - **Tip**: Use iterative prompting (e.g., via API calls) to refine outputs, as initial routing might not be perfect – re-prompt with feedback to re-route.

#### 3. **Handling Sparsity and Variability**:
   - Outputs can vary more across runs due to stochastic routing (if top-k selection has randomness), making deterministic prompting harder.
   - **Change**: Emphasize consistency techniques like temperature=0 (for greedy decoding) or repeated sampling to average expert activations. Also, test prompts across multiple runs to identify routing-sensitive ones. In production, this might require "prompt ensembles" where multiple variants are tried to hit the right experts.

#### 4. **Efficiency in Prompt Length and Complexity**:
   - Shorter, focused prompts can efficiently activate few experts, reducing latency – a boon for real-time apps.
   - **Change**: MoE encourages concise, intent-clear prompts over verbose ones. However, for creative or open-ended tasks, adding domain hints (e.g., "In the style of a sci-fi expert") can unlock diverse expert combinations without bloating the input.
   - **Few-Shot Learning**: Examples in prompts help "train" the router on-the-fly, making MoE more adaptable to custom tasks than dense models, but they must align with expert domains to avoid dilution.

#### 5. **Broader Implications and Best Practices**:
   - **Positive Shifts**: MoE reduces the need for heavy fine-tuning; prompt engineering can "fine-tune" via routing. It's great for multilingual or multimodal LLMs, where prompts specify modalities to route correctly.
   - **Challenges**: Black-box routing means trial-and-error is key – use A/B testing or logging to analyze which prompts activate desired behaviors. Ethically, be aware of potential biases if experts specialize unevenly (e.g., cultural experts).
   - **Evolving Landscape (as of 2025)**: With models like advanced Grok versions or Llama 3 MoE variants, tools like prompt optimizers (e.g., DSPy or Guidance) are adapting to simulate routing. Research suggests MoE amplifies prompt sensitivity, so hybrid approaches (combining with RAG for external knowledge) are rising.




## Small wording changes can steer which experts wake up

Because a router chooses experts *based on your tokens*, small wording changes can steer which experts wake up. That means prompt craft can influence which specialization you tap.

## Do more of this

1. **Front-load domain signals.** Put the clearest task + domain cues in the first few lines to help the router lock onto the right experts early.

   * “Role: Financial analyst. Task: 10-K variance analysis. Output: tabular summary + bullet risks.”
2. **Use unambiguous, domain-specific vocabulary.** The router keys off tokens; plain, on-topic terms beat clever phrasing or euphemisms.
3. **Separate mixed tasks.** If you combine coding, legal, and marketing in one shot, the router may oscillate experts. Break it into steps or run sequential prompts.
4. **Match examples to the task.** Few-shot exemplars should be in the *same domain, format, and language* as your goal—this strongly reinforces the intended experts.
5. **Be explicit about language and style.** Start with: “Language: Urdu. Style: concise, technical.” Multilingual MoE models often have language-specialized experts.
6. **Stabilize when you need consistency.** Lower temperature/top-p reduces token drift, which indirectly reduces expert churn across the generation.
7. **Keep retrieval context clean.** In RAG, put a short task summary *before* the docs, and keep the docs on-topic; noisy context can misroute tokens.

## Do less of this

* **Cute indirection (“you know what I mean”)**—it weakens routing signals.
* **Overlong preambles** that bury the true task. MoE routes per token, but early tokens set the scene.
* **Mashing multiple formats** (e.g., code + poetry + SQL) in one go—split it.

## A routing-friendly prompt skeleton

```
System/Intro:
  Role: <domain persona>
  Task: <crisp objective>
  Audience: <who/level>
  Language: <one language only>
  Output: <format + constraints>

Instructions:
  1) <step>
  2) <step>
  3) <step>

Examples (optional, tightly matched):
  <short in-domain example(s)>

Context (if any, trimmed to essentials):
  <RAG snippets or data>

Now solve the task.
```

## Troubleshooting with MoE models

* **Inconsistent answers across runs?** Add sharper domain anchors at the top; reduce temperature; include one very short, in-domain example.
* **It “misses” the skill you want (e.g., math vs. writing)?** Use explicit skill tags (“Task type: quantitative proof/derivation”) and show the target format in a tiny exemplar.
* **Mixed-topic responses?** Split the request; or ask for a plan first, then execute each step in a follow-up.

**Bottom line:** MoE doesn’t change the *foundation* of prompt engineering, but it **raises the leverage of clear, early, domain-specific signals** because they literally decide which specialists inside the model wake up for your tokens.
