## What is Context Engineering?

**Context Engineering** is the practice of designing and building dynamic systems that provide a Large Language Model (LLM) with the right information, in the right format, at the right time to accomplish a specific task.

In simpler terms, you're strategically "packing" the context window (the input area of an LLM) to maximize effectiveness. Think of it as creating the perfect instruction manual for your AI system.

### Key Analogy
As André Karpathy explains: **The LLM is the CPU, and the context window is the RAM**. Context engineering is about optimizing how you use that "RAM" space.

## Context Engineering vs Prompt Engineering

### Prompt Engineering
- **Use case**: Direct conversations with AI (like ChatGPT)
- **Example**: Asking about running shoes, discussing cushioning types, price ranges, outfit matching
- **Nature**: Back-and-forth conversational interaction
- **Complexity**: Simple, iterative refinement possible

### Context Engineering
- **Use case**: Building AI applications and agents
- **Example**: Customer service agent, sales assistant, coding agent
- **Nature**: Comprehensive, standalone instruction sets
- **Complexity**: Complex prompts that resemble code with XML tags and markdown

### Why the Distinction Matters
Context engineering isn't replacing prompt engineering—it's the evolution of prompt engineering for complex AI applications. When building AI agents, you can't iteratively refine responses in real-time. You need to anticipate all scenarios upfront.

---

## When to Use Context Engineering

Context engineering becomes essential when building AI applications that need to:

1. **Handle multiple scenarios autonomously**
   - Customer service inquiries (billing, refunds, login issues)
   - Escalation protocols
   - Edge cases and error handling

2. **Integrate with external systems**
   - API calls
   - Database queries
   - Third-party services

3. **Maintain consistency**
   - Brand voice and tone
   - Business rules and policies
   - Compliance requirements

4. **Process complex workflows**
   - Multi-step processes
   - Decision trees
   - Conditional logic

## The Six Essential Components of AI Agents

Every AI agent, regardless of its purpose, requires these six fundamental building blocks:

### 1. **Model**
- The core AI engine (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Can be large or small models
- Open source or proprietary
- Choose based on your specific needs

### 2. **Tools**
- Enable interaction with external systems
- Examples:
  - Calendar integration for scheduling
  - Email APIs for communication
  - Database connections for data retrieval
  - Payment processing systems

### 3. **Knowledge and Memory**
- **Knowledge**: Static information databases
- **Memory**: Dynamic conversation history and context retention
- Examples:
  - Legal case databases for legal agents
  - Previous therapy sessions for healthcare agents
  - Customer interaction history for support agents

### 4. **Audio and Speech**
- Voice input/output capabilities
- Makes interaction more natural
- Enables hands-free operation
- Improves accessibility

### 5. **Guardrails**
- Safety mechanisms for proper behavior
- Content filtering
- Boundary enforcement
- Examples:
  - Prevent inappropriate language in customer service
  - Maintain professional tone
  - Ensure compliance with regulations

### 6. **Orchestration**
- Deployment systems
- Monitoring and analytics
- Performance tracking
- Continuous improvement mechanisms

### The Burger Analogy
Think of these components like a burger:
- **Bun**: Model (holds everything together)
- **Patty**: Core functionality
- **Vegetables & Condiments**: Tools, knowledge, audio, guardrails
- **Assembly Instructions**: Context engineering (the prompt)

Just as you need instructions to assemble a burger properly, you need context engineering to coordinate all AI agent components effectively.

## Building AI Agents with Context Engineering

### The Role of Context Engineer
As a context engineer, you create the "instruction manual" that details:
- How all components work together
- When and how to use tools
- How to access memory and knowledge bases
- When to utilize speech and audio
- How to maintain guardrails
- Escalation procedures

### Prompt Complexity
Context-engineered prompts often become:
- Large and complex documents
- Structured with XML tags and markdown
- Code-like in appearance
- Comprehensive scenario coverage

---

## Real-World Example: AI Research Assistant

Here's a detailed breakdown of a context-engineered prompt for an AI research assistant:

### System Prompt Structure

#### **1. Role Definition**
```
You're an AI research assistant focused on identifying and summarizing recent trends in AI from multiple source types. Your job is to break down a user's query into actionable subtasks and return the most relevant insights based on engagement and authority.
```

#### **2. Task Breakdown**
Given a research query (delimited by XML tags), perform these steps:

**Step 1**: Extract up to 10 diverse, high-priority subtasks, each targeting different angles or source types

**Step 2**: Prioritize by:
- **Engagement**: Views, likes, reposts, citations
- **Authority**: Publication reputation, domain expertise

**Step 3**: Generate JSON output for each subtask in specified format

**Step 4**: Calculate correct start/end dates in UTC ISO format based on specified time period

**Step 5**: Summarize all findings into a concise trend summary (max 300 words)

#### **3. Input Format**
```xml
<user_query>
Insert search query here
</user_query>
```

#### **4. Output Specification**
Each subtask must follow this exact JSON format:
```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "query": "specific subquery related to main topic",
  "source_type": "news|X|Reddit|LinkedIn|newsletter|academic|specialized",
  "time_period": "1-10 days",
  "domain_focus": "technology|science|health",
  "priority": "1-10 (1=highest)",
  "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
}
```

#### **5. Final Output Requirements**
- Summarize key recent trends
- Limit to 300 words
- Use bullet points or short paragraphs
- Include only new, relevant, high-signal developments
- Avoid fluff, background, or personal commentary

#### **6. Constraints**
- Focus on main points succinctly
- Complete sentences and perfect grammar unnecessary
- No personal analysis or opinions
- Ignore background information and commentary

#### **7. Capabilities and Reminders**
- Access to web search tool for recent news articles
- Must be aware of current date for relevance
- Summarize only information published within past 10 days

### Implementation Notes
This example represents a relatively simple single-agent system. In practice, you might split this into multiple agents:
- **Agent 1**: Search and gather sources
- **Agent 2**: Summarize and synthesize findings

## Advanced Context Engineering Strategies

### 1. **Writing Context**
Allow your LLM to write down information about tasks to save and use later:
- Task decomposition notes
- Intermediate results
- Decision rationales
- Progress tracking

### 2. **Selecting Context**
Pull relevant information from external sources:
- Database queries based on current task
- API calls for real-time data
- Knowledge base searches
- User preference retrieval

### 3. **Compressing Context**
Handle information overload through:
- Summarization techniques
- Key point extraction
- Hierarchical information structure
- Token-efficient formatting

### 4. **Isolating Context**
Split context across different environments:
- Task-specific contexts
- User-specific information
- Temporal context separation
- Security boundary enforcement

### Multi-Agent Context Sharing
For multi-agent systems, follow these principles:
1. **Always share context between agents**
2. **Actions carry implicit decisions** - be careful at decision points in your architecture

## [Must Read: Effective context engineering for AI agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)

I'll fetch and summarize that article for you.Let me try searching for information about this article:
## Summary: Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents

Context engineering represents the evolution from prompt engineering to a broader discipline focused on optimizing the entire set of tokens available to an AI model during inference. Rather than just crafting perfect prompts, it's about answering: "What configuration of context is most likely to generate our model's desired behavior?"

### Key Concepts

**From Prompt to Context Engineering**
While prompt engineering focuses on writing effective instructions (particularly system prompts), context engineering manages the entire context state including system instructions, tools, external data, message history, and more. As agents operate over multiple turns and longer time horizons, they generate increasingly more data that must be cyclically refined and curated.

**Core Challenge: Limited Attention**
Despite growing context windows, LLMs experience "context rot" where the ability to accurately recall information decreases as token count increases, stemming from architectural constraints where every token attends to every other token. This makes context a precious, finite resource that must be carefully managed.

### Best Practices

**System Prompt Design**
System prompts should strike the "Goldilocks zone" - specific enough to guide behavior effectively, yet flexible enough to provide strong heuristics rather than brittle, hardcoded logic. Avoid two extremes: overly complex if-else statements and vague high-level guidance that assumes shared context.

**Tool and Resource Management**
Tools should use agent context judiciously through pagination, range selection, filtering, and truncation with sensible defaults to prevent consuming excessive tokens. Tool descriptions and specifications require careful prompt engineering with unambiguous naming and clear documentation, as if explaining to a new team member.

**Strategic Context Curation**
The goal is finding the smallest set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes. This involves determining what information should be loaded upfront versus fetched just-in-time, and continuously refining what stays in the context window as agents loop through multiple inference cycles.

This methodology is foundational for building reliable, long-running AI agents that can handle complex tasks without exhausting their context windows or losing critical information.

## What the article says — in brief from another viewpoint

* **Context engineering > prompt engineering.** As agents act over many turns, the challenge shifts from wording a single prompt to curating *everything* the model sees each step (system instructions, tool outputs, history, external data). The job is to assemble the smallest, highest-signal token set that maximizes correct behavior. ([Anthropic][1])

* **Context is finite and degrades.** LLMs have an “attention budget”; performance can drop as you add more tokens (“context rot”), due to transformer attention scaling and training distributions favoring shorter sequences. Treat context as scarce and manage it deliberately. ([Anthropic][1])

* **Anatomy of effective context.**

  * **System prompt:** clear, sectioned, and at the right “altitude”—not brittle if/else logic, not vague philosophy. Minimal but sufficient. ([Anthropic][1])
  * **Tools:** few, well-scoped, token-efficient, with unambiguous parameters; avoid bloated overlapping toolsets. ([Anthropic][1])
  * **Examples:** use a small set of canonical few-shot examples instead of stuffing edge cases. Keep message history tight. ([Anthropic][1])

* **Retrieval for agents: “just-in-time” beats stuffing.** Move beyond only pre-inference RAG: keep lightweight references (paths, queries, links) and load details at runtime via tools. A hybrid of small upfront context + on-demand exploration often works best. Principle: progressive disclosure to keep working memory clean. ([Anthropic][1])

* **Long-horizon work (minutes to hours) needs special tactics:**

  1. **Compaction:** periodically summarize the running trace and restart with the distilled state; first maximize recall, then prune. Clear old tool call outputs. ([Anthropic][1])
  2. **Structured note-taking (agentic memory):** persist notes (e.g., TODOs, decisions) outside the context window and re-inject later. ([Anthropic][1])
  3. **Sub-agent architectures:** specialized workers explore deeply, then return concise digests to a coordinator agent—clean separation of concerns and context. ([Anthropic][1])

* **Operating principle:** As models improve, they need less prescriptive scaffolding, but the north star remains the same—*do the simplest thing that works* and treat context as a precious resource at every turn. ([Anthropic][1])

# Practical checklist you can apply

1. Write a minimal, sectioned system prompt; test on hard cases, add only targeted guidance. ([Anthropic][1])
2. Trim your toolset; make each tool obvious to pick and token-efficient. ([Anthropic][1])
3. Keep 3–7 canonical examples; remove noisy edge-case sprawl. ([Anthropic][1])
4. Start with a tiny upfront bundle (instructions + immediate refs), then fetch details *just in time* via tools. ([Anthropic][1])
5. For long tasks, schedule compaction, maintain NOTES.md-style memory, and consider sub-agents for deep dives. ([Anthropic][1])
