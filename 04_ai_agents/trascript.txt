Today, we're going to be building this
0:01
AI system that automates newsletter
0:03
creation. The idea is that when the
0:04
system goes off, it'll do some initial
0:06
research to find good topics for the
0:08
newsletter. Then, we'll do deeper
0:09
research on those topics, write some
0:11
sections, and then the editor agent will
0:13
take all those sections and style it
0:14
together in HTML and send it off to you
0:17
for human approval. Like I said, I'm
0:18
going to build this live right in front
0:19
of you guys so I can explain what I'm
0:21
doing and why I'm doing it. So,
0:22
hopefully you guys find this one
0:23
helpful. Let's get right into it. So,
0:25
this is what the finished product will
0:26
look like. You can see it's not too
0:28
complicated. It's just a linear flow of
0:30
nodes. There are three AI steps, which
0:32
are these three different agents, and
0:34
we'll break down what they're all doing.
0:35
But high level, what the flow is is that
0:38
we're going to do research, send that
0:39
initial research into the planning agent
0:41
to create topics. We'll then do deeper
0:43
research on all of those topics, write
0:45
those sections based on those topics,
0:47
and then when we aggregate everything
0:49
together, the editor agent will
0:50
basically approve the final copy and
0:52
push it over to us on Gmail. Anyways,
0:54
this is kind of what the final product
0:56
looks like and it's a really holistic
0:58
newsletter and you could basically get
0:59
this sent to you as a draft once a week
1:01
or every single day or whatever it is.
1:03
Send it out to your team, send it out to
1:04
your email list, whatever you want to
1:05
do. But this is going to cut down all
1:07
the time of actually doing like the
1:08
research and now that you have this
1:10
draft here, you could basically just
1:12
make your small tweaks and shoot it off.
1:14
And just to get you guys inside my
1:15
mindset, when I'm looking at building a
1:17
system and I kind of know what I want as
1:19
the end result, but I don't know how to
1:20
get there exactly, what I do is I go to
1:22
some sort of whiteboard program tool
1:25
like Excal or Miro or whatever you want
1:28
to call them. And you can see here I
1:30
basically was brainstorming. Okay, so
1:31
mine I'm going to have this be a weekly
1:33
trigger. When this goes off, the first
1:34
thing I want to happen is research over
1:36
the past week to basically make sure
1:38
that this newsletter goes off once a
1:40
week and it's capturing all of the most
1:41
recent news. Based on the research from
1:44
the past week, I'm going to feed this
1:46
into an AI step. So, in my mind, this
1:48
green is indicating AI. So, this AI
1:50
would read the initial research and
1:52
create the title of the newsletter and
1:53
topics for this edition. Then, we would
1:56
have three different topics. So, we
1:57
would do research on each of those three
1:59
topics. we would pass the three topics
2:00
with the research along to the next AI
2:04
which will write each of the individual
2:05
sections. So now we'll have three
2:07
different newsletter sections written
2:09
and then what we want to do is bring it
2:10
all together. So we'll use an aggregate
2:12
node to put it all together and then
2:13
finally we'll feed it to a last AI which
2:15
we call the editor AI. And this AI's job
2:18
is to make sure it's HTML formatted,
2:20
make sure it has an introduction and a
2:21
conclusion and that everything flows and
2:23
then it's basically done and we send off
2:24
the draft and that's the end of the
2:26
process. And because we're going to be
2:27
building this together, I wanted to show
2:28
you the tech stack is really lean. We're
2:30
obviously going to use NIDAN as the main
2:32
workflow builder. We're going to be
2:33
using Tavi twice for different research
2:36
steps. We're going to be using Gmail
2:37
just to send the actual newsletter. And
2:39
then Open Router is what we're using for
2:41
all our AI models. We're probably going
2:43
to stick with some GBT 5 models today
2:45
just cuz it's new and it's fun to try it
2:46
out. But you could also experiment on
2:48
Open Router with some Google models or
2:50
anthropic models or DeepSeek, whatever
2:52
you want to use. Open Router has a ton
Build Starts
2:54
of them in there. So, now that we
2:55
understand what the system is that we're
2:57
going to be building, let's head over to
2:58
a fresh workflow in Naden and get
3:00
started. And because we have our
3:02
wireframe already diagrammed out, this
3:04
is really easy. I already know exactly
3:05
where I need to go. This first thing
3:06
that we're going to do is grab a
3:07
schedule trigger. And because I want
3:09
mine to go off once a week, I'm going to
3:11
change the interval to weeks. I'm going
3:13
to have it go off one week in between.
3:15
We'll do Sundays at midnight. That's
3:18
fine by me. And this is basically how
3:20
often the system would go off once we
3:22
push it into production. So once we make
3:24
it an active workflow, now this trigger
3:26
would actually go off once a week on
3:28
Sunday at midnight. I'm just going to
3:30
turn this off because we don't want to
3:31
do that yet. And now let's get started
3:32
on the build. So I know that the first
Tavily Setup
3:34
step that we want to happen after the
3:36
trigger goes off is to do some research.
3:38
So I'm going to click on this plus and
3:39
I'm going to type in Tavi, which is the
3:41
tool that we're going to use for
3:42
research. If you don't see Tavi, what
3:44
you're going to have to do is go to your
3:46
admin panel or if you're self-hosting,
3:48
update your end in a different way. And
3:50
you'll have to make sure you're on 1
3:52
point I think it's 101 or higher and
3:54
also that you have verified community
3:55
nodes turned on. And then you'll spin
3:57
back up your end and you should see
3:58
Tavi. You'll install it. And then you're
4:00
going to grab the search action. Now if
4:02
you don't have a Tavi API key, you can
4:05
start one up for free. You can get a,000
4:07
searches a month which will last you a
4:08
long time. And once you come into here
4:10
and create a new credential, you'll just
4:12
go to tavly.com and then when you create
4:14
an account, there'll be a button that
4:15
says create an API key. You'll grab that
4:17
API key and just put that right in
4:19
there. Super simple. But now we have to
4:21
make our actual search. So the query
4:24
right here is where we enter your broad
4:27
category or niche or topic of your, you
4:29
know, newsletter. So let's say mine is
4:32
AI adoption for small businesses.
4:36
That's what I'm going to put right in
4:37
here. And this is going to stay the same
4:38
every single time this workflow goes
4:40
off.
4:42
Now I want to add some options. The
4:44
first thing that I'm going to add is a
4:45
topic. And these are all options that we
4:47
can use to change the way that Tableau
4:49
searches the web for us. So I'm going to
4:50
go to topic and instead of doing
4:52
general, I'm going to choose news
4:53
because then it's like more looking for
4:55
recent things and like headlines, stuff
4:57
like that. From there, I'm going to also
4:59
do time range. So I only want to search
5:02
within the past week. That way we know
5:05
it's all like things that are trending,
5:07
things that are currently happening. And
5:08
then you can see there's other things
5:10
that we can do. I'm also going to turn
5:11
on max results. You don't have to do
5:13
this, but I'm just going to go with
5:14
three for now. especially just because
5:16
I'm doing a live build demo. So, these
5:18
are the options that I currently want.
5:20
I'm going to hit execute step. And now
5:22
you can see we're going to get back
5:24
three different URLs with kind of like
5:26
some summarized content about small
5:29
business AI adoption. So, we have the
5:31
small business technology gap. We have
5:33
SMB's hoham on AI versus automation, all
5:37
this kind of stuff. And you can see the
5:38
publish date. These are all coming from
5:40
within the past week. So, we know our
5:42
options are working. Now, real quick,
5:44
just some workflow hygiene. I'm going to
5:46
rename this node. I hit spacebar, by the
5:48
way, when I clicked on it. And I'm just
5:50
going to say initial research. This is
5:52
just a good habit to get into so you can
5:54
know what each node is doing. Uh,
5:56
another good habit to get into is
5:57
pinning data. So, I can click on this
5:59
and hit P. And now we don't have to
6:01
re-trigger that API call if we
6:02
accidentally like refresh or whatever it
6:04
is. Um, just to keep all that live data
6:06
in there. Cool. So, we've done our
Planning Agent
6:09
initial research. Next is well, let's
6:12
just go look at the di the the diagram
6:14
of the wireframe here. The next thing to
6:16
do is use AI to create titles and topics
6:19
out of that initial research. So, I'm
6:21
going to go back into the workflow. I'm
6:22
going to grab an AI agent. And now, we
6:24
need to do some configuration of this
6:26
step here. The first thing I'm going to
6:28
do real quick is add our chat model. So,
6:30
I'm going to go to Open Router like we
6:31
talked about. Same thing here. If you
6:33
don't have an Open Router account,
6:34
you'll go to open router.ai. You'll make
6:37
an account. And when you create an API
6:38
key, you basically just put that right
6:40
in here. So very simple. Again, we're
6:43
gonna actually go to GBT 5 mini for this
6:47
step. And now what we need to do is a
6:50
few other things. We need to configure
6:53
what the agent looks at, what the agent
6:56
instructions are, and then potentially
6:58
an output format. So I'll show you guys
7:00
what I mean by that. The first thing
7:01
that we need to do is we need to give it
7:04
basically like this is your message.
7:06
this is what you're looking at. So
7:07
instead of doing that here in the
7:09
connected chat trigger node, we have to
7:11
define that. And what we wanted to look
7:13
at is pretty simple. We wanted to look
7:15
at the research results from our Tavly
7:17
node. So basically what I would do is I
7:20
would say you know like here is article
7:25
oops I cannot type today. Here's article
7:26
one and then I would just basically like
7:28
drag in here's the URL here's the title
7:30
here is the content of article one. So
7:33
you could do that. It's a bit more
7:35
manual and you know obviously this looks
7:37
weird because the variables are all
7:38
smooshed together. You'd probably want
7:40
to format it like this. And now that's
7:41
article one. But what I'm going to do
7:43
instead is I'm going to go to this
7:44
resource pack which you guys can get in
7:46
my free school community. I'm going to
7:48
grab this function right here and I'm
7:50
just going to paste that in here. And
7:51
all that does is it's basically grabbing
7:54
this array of results and it's just
7:56
formatting it for us pretty much like
7:59
natively. And that way our agent can
8:01
read it and understand what it's looking
8:02
at. And this is just going to be a lot
8:04
easier and more dynamic than if we
8:06
basically hardfixed in different
8:07
variables and dragged them in. So in
8:09
order to actually grab this resource
8:10
pack and if you want to just download
8:12
the actual automation rather than build
8:14
it yourself, you can do that as well.
8:15
You're going to go to my free school
8:16
community. The link for that is down in
8:18
the description. When you get in here,
8:20
you're going to search for the title of
8:21
the video or go to YouTube resources and
8:23
find the post associated with this
8:25
YouTube video. And when you click on it,
8:27
there will be a JSON file to download.
8:29
There will be a PDF. you can download
8:30
all the resources that you need right
8:32
from this post. So that's how you'll get
8:34
everything and now that you have it,
8:36
follow along with the rest of the video.
8:37
So that's all that's going on here. But
8:40
once again, you could manually drag the
8:42
stuff in. So now that we have the agent
8:44
is looking at our three articles, we
8:46
need to tell it what to do with these
8:47
three articles. And that's where we come
8:49
down here and we add a system message.
8:51
So real quick, I'm just going to make
8:52
this an expression so we can open up
8:54
full screen. And I'm also going to go
8:56
back to the resource pack and I'm going
8:57
to copy in this system message that I'll
8:59
give you guys again in my free school
9:01
community and paste that in. So all I'm
9:04
saying here is that you are an expert
9:05
newsletter planner. You will receive
9:07
three articles from the past week. Your
9:09
job is to come up with a creative and
9:10
fun title as well as the main topics for
9:12
the newsletter. So this AI is
9:14
specialized in just this function. It
9:16
would be way too overwhelming if we gave
9:18
our agent all this research, all these
9:20
articles and said, "Hey, just write a
9:22
newsletter." So, I like to break it up
9:23
in steps and have each AI do something
9:25
very specialized. The instructions down
9:27
here say that the newsletter should flow
9:29
nicely, feel informative and holistic,
9:31
and that the topic should be three to
9:33
five words. So, what I'm going to do now
9:35
is just hit execute step. And what we're
9:37
going to see is that the agent's going
9:38
to use its brain. Right now, in order to
9:40
output the title and the three topics
9:43
for us, there is one thing that we're
9:45
going to have to do, but I just wanted
9:46
to run this first to show you guys the
9:47
difference here, and that is that we're
9:49
going to require a specific output
9:51
because what you see here is it did its
9:53
job. It output a title and then it
9:56
output different topics as you can see,
9:58
but it's all in one field. Meaning, if
10:00
we moved on to the next step, let me
10:01
just add like a set node just to show
10:03
you guys, it would all be in one
10:04
variable. And if we dragged it in, we
10:06
couldn't really separate it. like it's
10:07
it's all together. So, what we want to
10:09
do is just get it all separate. So, I'm
10:11
going to go back into the resource pack.
10:12
I'm going to copy the structured output
10:14
parser JSON and then I'm going to turn
10:17
on this option that says require
10:19
specific output format. And now we are
10:21
in even more control of the way the
10:23
agent outputs information. So, I'm going
10:25
to choose the structure output parser.
10:26
This part's important. I'm going to
10:28
change the type to define using JSON
10:30
schema. And then just paste in that
10:32
value that we got from that resource
10:33
pack. And I can hit play on the agent
10:36
right here. And this is going to do the
10:37
exact same thing except for now it's
10:39
going to put it in that format that we
10:40
were looking for. And you guys will see
10:42
the difference once this spins out. So
10:45
you can see now we have these things are
10:47
in different fields so we could actually
10:48
drag them differently. So that's great.
10:50
I'm also going to pin this data so we
10:52
don't have to rerun our agent if
10:54
something goes wrong. And we're going to
10:55
move on to the next step.
Deeper Research
10:57
So what we're going to do now is we're
11:00
going to use a node called split out.
11:02
What this is going to do is it's going
11:03
to take this list of topics. As you can
11:05
see, we have topic one, two, and three.
11:07
And we are going to just split them out.
11:09
So now it went from one list, one item
11:11
to three items out here. And this is
11:13
nice because what we're going to do is
11:15
we're going to use Tavi again to do
11:17
research on each of these three things
11:18
individually. So I'm just going to pin
11:20
this data. I am going to grab another
11:23
Tavi node. We're going to do another
11:24
search. And I'm just going to drag in
11:27
the
11:28
um the topic into the query. So this is
11:31
going to run Tavi three separate times.
11:33
The first time it's going to run it for
11:34
bridging the tech gap. The second time
11:36
it's going to run it for SMB attitudes
11:38
towards AI. And the third time it's
11:40
going to run it for practical AI tools
11:41
guide. Before we run this, we need to do
11:44
some more options. So the first thing
11:46
I'm going to do is for topic, we're
11:47
going to leave that as general. So you
11:48
actually don't even have to add that.
11:50
It's general by default. Um you could
11:52
play with the time range if you want.
11:54
For for now, let's just say we're going
11:56
to go just the past month. But the main
11:59
important thing that I want to do is
12:01
include raw content. I'm going to turn
12:03
this on because you guys may have not
12:05
noticed, but in this first step, we had
12:08
include raw content turned off. And what
12:10
that meant is that we were getting
12:13
basically just like a summary from each
12:14
article, but we weren't getting the
12:16
actual raw content. And that's what we
12:18
want to write the newsletter. So, here
12:20
I'm going to make sure that's on. I'm
12:22
going to change this name to
12:25
research topics.
12:28
Okay. My fingers are a little cold, so
12:30
my typing has been awful. But anyways,
12:32
we're going to execute the step. And you
12:34
can see that there's three items going
12:35
in. There's going to be three items
12:37
coming out. So, there's going to be
12:38
different research on all those topics
12:40
like I already mentioned. Real quick,
Sponsor: Hostinger n8n VPS
12:42
guys, a word from the sponsor of today's
12:44
video, Hostinger. All end workflows need
12:46
a place to reliably run 24/7 and scale
12:48
up as you need to. And that's where
12:50
Hostinger comes in. What we're looking
12:51
at right here is Hostinger self-hosted
12:53
naden with unlimited workflows,
12:55
unlimited executions, community nodes,
12:57
and a one-click installation. So, I'm
12:58
going to show you guys how that works
12:59
real quick. You'll click on choose your
13:01
plan, and you can see they have
13:02
different options based on the amount of
13:04
storage and processing power that you
13:05
need. Right now, we're going to go with
13:06
KVM2, which is the most popular plan. On
13:09
this panel, you can see how long do you
13:10
want the period to run. You can get
13:11
daily backups. You choose your server.
13:13
And here's where you would choose NAND
13:15
as your application. And of course, if
13:16
you're getting a yearly plan, don't
13:18
forget to use code Nate Herk right here,
13:19
and you can get 10% off your NADN. Now
13:22
that I've paid, I just have to set up a
13:23
password, and we'll be all set. So, now
13:25
that everything is spun up, you can see
13:26
the overview right here. I just have to
13:28
click on manage app to the right of end
13:30
and it's just going to pull up our end
13:31
right here. Just spun up my account and
13:33
now you can see we have our self-hosted
13:34
end right here. And that took minutes.
13:37
So if you're like me, not super
13:38
technical, especially when it comes to
13:40
DevOps stuff, but you obviously know you
13:42
need somewhere safe and reliable to host
13:43
your ended workflows and have daily
13:45
backups stuff like that, then use the
13:47
link in the description to check out
13:48
Hostinger. And don't forget to use code
13:49
Nate Herk. So while this finishes up,
Section Writer Agent
13:52
we're going to pin it when it's done so
13:53
we don't have to re-trigger the
13:55
research. So I'm just going to come in
13:56
here real quick and pin that data. And
13:58
now you can see that we are getting um
14:00
let's see schema might be the easiest
14:02
but we're getting research on different
14:03
topics. So the first one was bridging
14:05
the tech tech gap and then the next two
14:07
topics as well. So we have gotten our
14:12
title and topics. We have done the
14:13
research. Now we need to use AI again to
14:16
write the actual newsletter sections. So
14:18
I'm going to grab another AI agent right
14:20
here. We are once again real quick going
14:23
to connect open router. And actually a
14:24
fun trick, you can just hook them up to
14:26
the same model if you want them to use
14:27
the same model. Obviously, if you want
14:29
the agents to use different models, you
14:30
would have to create a new one, but
14:32
they're going to use the same one, so
14:33
that's fine. I'm going to change this
14:35
agent to let's see what I what I named
14:37
him in here, the section writer agent.
14:39
So, I'm just going to copy this
14:40
actually, and I'm going to change this
14:42
agent's name here. And now, same thing.
14:45
We have to configure the user message,
14:47
what the agent sees, and the system
14:49
message, its instructions. So, I'm going
14:51
to open this guy up. We're going to
14:52
first of all change the user message to
14:54
define below because we want to define
14:56
what it looks at. And what do we want it
14:59
to look at? We basically want it to look
15:01
at all of the search results for the
15:03
given topic as well as the query that it
15:06
was given. So what I'm going to do here
15:08
is basically just say um actually not
15:11
query, I'm going to say topic.
15:13
So basically I'm telling the the this
15:16
agent you're going to write a section of
15:18
a newsletter. here is the main topic or
15:20
heading and then I'm going to give you
15:22
these results down here. These are like
15:24
the article results. So that is what we
15:26
would give it. But we get this weird
15:28
object object thing. So we'd have to
15:30
like do a join expression to be able to
15:32
see it. Or obviously you could drag in
15:34
like you know here's the URL, here's the
15:37
title, here is the raw content from that
15:39
article, but we don't want to do it that
15:41
way because it's not as variable. So,
15:43
I'm going to go back to the resource
15:44
pack and I'm just going to grab this
15:47
JSON function, which is going to do the
15:49
same thing as it did earlier, where it
15:51
basically is just going to split out all
15:52
of the research in a way that the agent
15:54
can read really nicely. So, that's the
15:56
only reason we're using a function
15:58
there.
15:59
Cool. So, it gets the topic and
16:01
research. Once again, this agent's going
16:03
to do it three times. So, the first time
16:04
it's going to do bridging the tech gap.
16:06
Second time it's going to do SMB
16:07
attitudes towards AI. And the third time
16:09
it's going to do practical AI tools
16:11
guide. Now, we need to add another
16:13
system message so it can actually see,
16:15
okay, I'm getting this stuff. What do I
16:17
do with it? So, of course, for the sake
16:19
of time, I've already pre-written this.
16:20
I'm going to grab this system message,
16:22
which is actually pretty short. And once
16:24
again, you guys will get this in my free
16:25
school community. I'll show you guys
16:26
later how you actually do that. Um, and
16:29
what you do is you're going to come in
16:30
here and you're going to hit paste.
16:34
So, now we have this system message with
16:37
an overview, which is that you are
16:38
professional newsletter section writer.
16:40
Your only task is to write one
16:42
standalone section of a newsletter. Your
16:44
instructions are to always include a
16:45
clear section heading. Do not write an
16:47
overall title, introduction, or
16:49
conclusion. You're just writing one
16:50
little section. Write in a professional,
16:52
expert, and engaging tone in your if you
16:56
reference facts, data, or quotes. You
16:57
must site the source. Um, all this kind
16:59
of stuff. And these prompts, keep in
17:01
mind, are where you can really come in
17:03
here and make this newsletter a lot more
17:04
tailored towards your business, your
17:07
ICP, you know, anything like that. This
17:09
is where you can put your own spin on
17:10
it. This one and the editor one for
17:12
sure. But anyways, it's a good place to
17:14
start. And now what I'm going to do is
17:16
just hit execute step. And we don't need
17:19
a structured output parser here. You
17:21
could split them up in between like the
17:22
header and the body, but we're going to
17:24
combine it all together later either
17:25
way. So I'm just going to go ahead and
17:27
run this section writer agent right now.
17:30
All right. So the section writer just
17:31
finished up. We'll take a quick look. If
17:33
we go to the table view, we can see that
17:35
the first section comes out with this
17:36
heading and then we have um different
17:39
little pieces in here and it is using
17:41
its sources. So that's good. Here is the
17:44
second section which is SMB attitudes
17:45
towards AI adoption. And then the third
17:47
one comes out as well. So now that we
Editor Agent
17:50
have all that figured out, let me just
17:51
move this back to the middle. What we
17:53
need to do now is first of all, I'm just
17:54
going to pin this so we don't lose it.
17:56
And now we need to bring it all back
17:58
together and then have an editor agent
18:00
make it stylized with HTML. So it looks
18:03
nice. So in order to get everything back
18:05
together, we're going to do another data
18:07
transformation node, which is called an
18:09
aggregate. And this is going to bring
18:11
our three items over here back into one.
18:13
As you can see right here, we basically
18:14
said 3 to one, bring it all together,
18:16
and then we're going to stylize and
18:17
edit. So all I have to do is say that
18:20
we're going to just combine this field
18:22
called output into one. So now we should
18:25
be getting one item over here that has
18:27
all three of those sections combined as
18:28
you can see. Perfect.
18:31
Now, I'm going to add another AI agent,
18:33
which is our final AI agent. We're going
18:35
to real quick go grab a chat model. And
18:37
the reason I'm grabbing one myself is
18:39
because for this writing, because it's
18:41
like HTML and we want it to really sound
18:43
nice, I'm going to use GBT5 rather than
18:46
these other ones where I was using GPT5
18:48
Mini. So, we're going to use GBT5 here.
18:51
I'm also going to call this guy real
18:52
quick, the editor agent. And again, we
18:56
have a couple things to set up. system
18:58
message, user message, and we are we are
19:01
going to again do a structured output
19:03
parser. So, first of all, let's do the
19:05
user message. We're not going to do
19:06
this. You only do this if you use a chat
19:08
trigger. So, we're not using a chat
19:10
trigger. So, we're going to define
19:11
below.
19:13
What we wanted to look at are the three
19:15
different sections. So, what you could
19:18
do is you could basically go like, you
19:20
know, here's section one, hit enter,
19:23
here's section two, hit enter a few
19:25
times, and then here's section three.
19:26
There's nothing wrong with that and you
19:28
certainly can. But just to get you guys
19:30
more comfortable with like the way you
19:31
can use functions to make things a bit
19:35
more dynamic. You could drag in this
19:37
array right here. And this is similar to
19:39
what we were doing earlier. You can
19:41
after the output type in join. And this
19:44
basically joins together the items of
19:45
the array. And then you can also in here
19:48
specify what to do between each join. So
19:51
let me find the good point right here.
19:53
So the second output starts with SMB
19:55
attitudes towards AI. So let me just
19:57
find that real quick. Um
20:01
we'll find it. We'll find it. We'll find
20:02
it.
20:05
Okay, I found it right here. SMB
20:06
attitudes towards AI. And you can see
20:08
that it basically starts
20:11
right away like combined with the end of
20:14
output one. So we don't want to do that.
20:16
So if I come here and I type in a quote
20:19
and do a new line symbol, it's going to
20:21
space it out. And if I do one more, and
20:23
if I do one more, it spaces it out even
20:24
more. So now it's very clear where this
20:28
second section basically starts. So
20:31
that's what we're going to do here. That
20:33
is what I did down here in the um what's
20:35
it called? The resource pack. I have the
20:37
sections with the three new lines after
20:39
a join. So once again, you could also
20:41
just grab this user message and then
20:44
paste that in there and you will get the
20:46
title and the sections.
20:48
The reason why the title is being weird
20:50
is because we grabbed the title back
20:52
from the initial agent called the
20:53
planning agent. And it's because I
20:55
didn't name it planning agent. So if I
20:57
literally just went back all the way
20:59
over here, oops, and I just named this
21:01
guy
21:03
planning agent. That should have fixed
21:05
it basically. So now it's green. You can
21:06
see I fixed it. Now it knows what's a
21:08
reference. So this editor agent is
21:10
receiving the title as well as all of
21:12
the sections of the newsletter. And now
21:14
all it has to do is it has to understand
21:16
I need to create the intro and the
21:17
conclusion and like a sources section at
21:19
the bottom. So that's where we're going
21:20
to tell it to do that in the system
21:22
message. So let me real quick just make
21:24
this full screen. Go to our resource
21:25
pack and I'm going to grab the system
21:27
message. You can see this is the longest
21:28
one out of all of the other ones that
21:30
we've had today. And I'm just going to
21:32
paste this in right here. I'm not going
21:35
to read the whole thing. You guys
21:36
obviously have access to the template.
21:38
You can also pause the video as I scroll
21:40
down if you want to be able to read the
21:41
whole thing. But what we're doing here
21:43
is we're defining its role. We're
21:45
telling it what to do. And then we're
21:47
giving it the structure of HTML so that
21:49
it has like headings and bold and and
21:51
clickable links and stuff like that. So
21:53
that's how we're doing it here. And what
21:55
I'm going to do now is before we
21:57
actually run it, explain why we need a
21:59
structured output parser. So I'm going
22:01
to connect the structure output parser
22:02
and then I'm going to explain why.
22:04
Because what we're doing is we're having
22:07
this editor agent output the title of
22:09
the email as a subject. or in a subject
22:12
field. And then it's going to output the
22:16
actual content of the newsletter in a
22:18
field called content. And the reason why
22:21
we need to do this is because we're
22:22
going to send the newsletter in Gmail.
22:25
And we want to have two fields that we
22:26
can drag off. The first one being the
22:28
subject, the second one being the email
22:29
body. So that's why we're doing a
22:30
structured output parser here. This is
22:32
probably going to take anywhere from 30
22:34
seconds to a minute and 30 seconds. So I
22:37
will let this spin. We will configure
22:40
the Gmail node and shoot that off and
22:41
then we'll take a look at it together.
22:42
So, all right. So, that run actually
22:44
took like four minutes. I earlier when I
22:47
was doing this, they weren't always
22:48
taking that long. I don't know, maybe
22:49
just the time of day. But either way,
Sending Draft
22:51
before we actually read it and see how
22:53
it came out, I'm just going to pin this
22:54
data real quick so we don't have to wait
22:56
another four freaking minutes. And then
22:58
I'm going to add a Gmail node. So, I'm
23:00
going to grab this node. And what we're
23:02
going to do is create a draft. So, if
23:05
you don't have if you haven't connected
23:06
your Gmail account, you're basically
23:07
just going to sign in, create your
23:09
account, and now, like I said, we have
23:11
our subject and our message. And because
23:14
we actually already, you know, separated
23:16
them out with our structured output
23:17
parser. Super easy. We just drag in the
23:19
subject. We drag in the drag in the
23:21
content. And now the only thing we have
23:23
to do is change the email type to HTML
23:26
because we formatted it as HTML or our
23:30
editor agent did. And if we sent it as
23:32
text, then it would not actually be
23:34
formatted. It would just have this like
23:35
weird -p-p2.
23:38
It would just have that everywhere. So,
23:40
we have it as email. And then also, you
23:42
have options down here. So, you can send
23:43
it to someone, you can attach things,
23:44
you can send it to someone. I'm real
23:46
quick just going to send it to Nate
23:47
Herk8 Gmail, which is just like my test
23:50
email for all this end stuff. And now
23:52
that we have that set up, I can hit
23:54
execute step. And this is just going to
23:56
notify us that it was in fact sent. So,
Newsletter Draft
23:58
I'm going to head over to the Gmail and
24:00
we're going to take a look at this
24:01
newsletter draft. All right. So, in my
24:03
drafts, here it is. You can see that we
24:05
have our title from gap to growth small
24:08
biz tech playbook. We have a quick
24:10
little brief which is, you know, as of
24:13
August 17th, 2025, many leaders are
24:15
tackling the same challenge from
24:16
different angles, closing tech gaps,
24:18
turning cautious interest in AI into
24:20
confident use, and giving teams a
24:22
practical toolkit. This edition connects
24:24
those threads with actionable steps,
24:25
evidence on SMB attitudes, and a fast
24:27
start guide to tools and governance. So,
24:30
what you see here is that we have our
24:31
three main source sections. We have
24:34
bridging the gap, we have SMB attitudes,
24:36
and we have practical tools guide. We
24:39
also have a list down here at the bottom
24:41
of sources. So, we know that all of this
24:43
newsletter was written by real sources
24:46
that have, you know, we can click into
24:48
these right here and it will take us
24:49
right to them and we can basically see
24:51
why it wrote that. We have a quick
24:53
little sign off. And then the thing to
24:56
notice here is that we also have sources
24:59
after each sentence. So, you can see
25:00
where each sentence came from. If you
25:03
don't like the way that it literally
25:04
just says source, you could easily go
25:05
back into the editor prompt and say, you
25:06
know, hey, like maybe this source should
25:09
be called Forbes because it came from
25:10
Forbes. And this one should be called,
25:12
that one's also Forbes. This one should
25:13
be called Euro News because it came from
25:15
there. All stuff that you can play with
25:17
in the system prompt to make it tailored
25:19
towards the way you want your newsletter
25:21
to be written. So, I'm not going to read
25:23
through this whole thing. I think you
25:24
guys can see how this works. Um, it
25:26
seems like it it's flowing very nice.
25:28
You could obviously play with the
25:29
different chat models. In the past when
25:31
I've done newsletter creation, I've
25:32
liked to use Claude because I really
25:34
like the way that it writes. But GBT5 so
25:36
far I've been very impressed with as
25:37
well. You can see down here we've got a
25:39
lot of different sources for different
25:41
tools, different AI tools. Apologies if
25:43
you hear the fire truck that's zooming
25:45
down the street down there. But anyways,
25:47
this is kind of what the final product
25:48
looks like. And it's a really holistic
25:50
newsletter. And you could basically get
25:51
this sent to you as a draft once a week
25:54
or every single day or whatever it is.
25:55
Send it out to your team, send it out to
25:57
your email list, whatever you want to
25:58
do. But this is going to cut down all
25:59
the time of actually doing like the
26:01
research and now that you have this
26:02
draft here, you could basically just
26:04
make your small tweaks and shoot it off.
26:06
So, in order to actually grab this
26:07
resource pack and if you want to just
26:09
download the actual automation rather
26:11
than build it yourself, you can do that
26:12
as well. You're going to go to my free
26:14
school community. The link for that is
26:15
down in the description. When you get in
26:17
here, you're going to search for the
26:18
title of the video or go to YouTube
26:20
resources and find the post associated
26:22
with this YouTube video. And when you
26:24
click on it, there will be a JSON file
26:25
to download. There will be a PDF. you
26:27
can download all the resources that you
26:29
need right from this post. So that's how
26:31
you'll get everything and now that you
26:32
have it, follow along with the rest of
26:34
the video. So that is pretty much the
26:36
whole system. You guys saw me build this
Scaling this System
26:38
entire thing. Hopefully I explained kind
26:39
of like why I was doing things. I would
26:41
basically now want to just select all
26:42
these, hit P to unpin them if that
26:46
works. I thought that did work. I don't
26:47
know why it's not letting me do that.
26:48
Well, I'll just do it the manual way. So
26:50
I'm unpinning everything. I would save
26:51
it. I would push this into production by
26:54
making this active. So now this trigger
26:55
would actually go off every single week
26:58
and you pretty much have just built your
26:59
first workflow. Now from here there's a
27:01
lot of things you'd want to do next. The
27:03
first one that I would recommend is have
27:05
a log of all the newsletters that have
27:07
gone out. That way you can you can track
27:09
them when they've gone out. You can give
27:11
feedback in like a Google sheet and that
27:13
way you can see your feedback over time
27:15
in order to make these changes in the
27:17
different prompts of the agents if you
27:19
don't like how something's happening.
27:21
There's of course tons of other stuff
27:22
that you can do from here to make this
27:24
smarter. Not only do you want to log it
27:26
so you can revisit the prompting and
27:28
stuff, but you want to log so that you
27:30
can have error handling in place. And
27:32
you also want to be able to, you know,
27:34
customize your HTML styling and human in
27:36
the loop revision stuff like that. You
27:38
could also actually change the workflow
27:40
logic so that you're not just doing
27:41
research on Tavi. Maybe you want to use
27:43
Perplexity and Tableau and then bring
27:45
those back together. Or maybe you want
27:46
to use SER API and bring all that
27:48
together. So now it's really up to you
27:50
since you have this nice template to
27:51
start from. Understand what happens in
27:54
each step, how you're able to customize
27:56
each step, and if you want to improve
27:58
certain areas, you know, make it your
28:00
own. So I've showed you guys the free
28:01
community where you can download this
28:02
exact template if you just want to plug
28:04
it in right away and start playing with
28:05
it or if you want to grab this resource
28:07
pack, of course, with all the prompts
28:08
that we use today. But if you're looking
Want to Master n8n?
28:10
to take your skills further or you're
28:12
looking for, you know, some more
28:13
hands-on support, then definitely check
28:14
out my plus community. The link for that
28:16
is also down in the description. We've
28:17
got a great community of members who are
28:19
building with any every single day.
28:20
They're sharing their learnings, their
28:22
wins, their challenges, all this kind of
28:23
stuff. We also have a classroom section
28:25
with two full courses, agent zero, which
28:27
is the foundations for beginners, and
28:29
then 10 hours to 10 seconds where you
28:31
learn how to identify, design, and build
28:33
time-saving automations. So, if you like
28:34
the whole way that I go about, you know,
28:36
trying to understand the tech stack and
28:38
wireframing and everything before you
28:39
get into it, that's something that I
28:40
talk about in this course as well. So,
28:42
I'd love to see you guys in these
28:43
communities. But that's going to do it
28:44
for today. If you enjoyed the video or
28:46
you learned something new, please give
28:47
it a like. It definitely helps me out a
28:48
ton. And as always, I appreciate you
28:50
guys making it to the end of the video.
28:52
I'll see you all in the next one.
